Pre-Highway Call:
Jumped the gun a lil bit and made an SVG of a bow for my PCB shape. I used blender because, hey, it works (and also I couldn’t deal with Figma on a touchpad).
Used a curve to create one quadrant, flipped it across the X and Y axes, and converted it to grease pencil with a high resolution for rendering.

Finally finished the schematic. Took me absolutely forever to figure out how resistors work ;,(

Basic PCB design (without traces yet) done!

Welp, I thought I was done, turns out the DRC decided to chuck around 100 errors at me that I had to fix in sequence (simplify polygons is a life saver for duplicated vectors). Anyways, I SHOULD be finished now!!!

I was so very wrong. I think I’m just going to use my svg as a guide and trace it in KiCad myself.

Have had pretty much no luck with tracing, only throwing more errors. Tried figma but it ended up looking pretty bad. Will likely try again tomorrow to make the blend file work, but need to both eat dinner and sleep first, so that’s wraps for today.
