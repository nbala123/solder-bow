# Solder Bow

A bow-shaped PCB designed for Highway to Undercity! (Starter project: Solder)

This bow features a photoresistor that allows the LED lights on the bow-shaped PCB to glow when the surroundings are dark. All the traces are on the front side of the pcb to allow me to, in the future, attatch a clip to the bottom of it and either wear it or clip it onto something else. Files will be added when the design actually works.
